# spring-ai-llama2
#### **Overview**

This proof of concept (PoC) showcases the integration of the LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) with a Spring Boot application. The goal is to demonstrate how to utilize LLaMA for generating text responses based on user inputs, highlighting its capabilities in natural language processing.

#### **Features**

Spring Boot: Utilize Spring Boot for rapid application development and configuration.

LLaMA Integration: Connect to the LLaMA model to generate responses based on user prompts.

RESTful API: Expose a REST API for users to interact with the generative model.

Asynchronous Processing: Implement asynchronous request handling to improve responsiveness.

#### **Architecture**

Spring Boot Application: The main application that handles API requests and integrates with the LLaMA model.

LLaMA Model: The generative AI model used for processing text and generating responses.

#### **Prerequisites**

Java 11+

Access to the LLaMA model (ensure it is set up in your environment)

Maven or Gradle for dependency management

A suitable inference library or framework compatible with LLaMA (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers)
