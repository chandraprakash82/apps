# observability-demo

#### **Overview**

This proof of concept (PoC) showcases observability features in a Spring Boot application using Spring Data JPA. The goal is to demonstrate how to implement monitoring and logging capabilities to gain insights into application performance and data interactions.

#### **Features**

Spring Boot: Leverage Spring Boot for rapid application development.

Spring Data JPA: Utilize Spring Data JPA for database interactions and entity management.

Observability Tools: Integrate tools like Spring Boot Actuator, Micrometer, and an APM solution (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for monitoring.

Logging: Implement structured logging to capture important application events and database operations.

#### **Architecture**

Spring Boot Application: The main application that handles business logic and API requests.

Database: An SQL database (e.g., H2, PostgreSQL) used for storing application data.

Monitoring Tools: Use observability tools for metrics and health monitoring.

#### **Prerequisites**

Java 17+

An SQL database (e.g., H2, PostgreSQL) installed or configured

Maven or Gradle for dependency management
