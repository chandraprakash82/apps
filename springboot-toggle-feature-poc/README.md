# toggle-feature

#### **Overview**

This proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the implementation of feature toggles in a Spring Boot application. The goal is to show how to enable or disable features dynamically without requiring code changes or redeployment, improving flexibility and control over application functionality.

#### **Features**

Spring Boot: Utilize Spring Boot for rapid application development.

Feature Toggle Implementation: Use a configuration-based approach to manage feature toggles.

Dynamic Control: Enable or disable features at runtime based on configuration.

Integration with Profiles: Use Spring profiles to manage different feature sets for development, testing, and production.

#### **Architecture**

Spring Boot Application: The main application that demonstrates feature toggling.

Configuration Management: Use application properties or an external configuration service to manage toggle states.

#### **Prerequisites**

Java 11+

Maven or Gradle for dependency management
