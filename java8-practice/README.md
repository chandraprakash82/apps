# Java 8 features

#### **Overview**

This proof of concept (PoC) showcases key features introduced in Java 8, including Stream APIs, lambda expressions, and functional interfaces. The aim is to demonstrate how these features can simplify and enhance Java programming, making code more readable and efficient.

#### **Features**

Lambda Expressions: Use concise syntax to represent anonymous functions and improve code readability.

Stream APIs: Leverage streams to process collections of data in a functional style, enabling efficient data manipulation.

Functional Interfaces: Implement interfaces with a single abstract method, enabling the use of lambda expressions.


#### **Prerequisites**
