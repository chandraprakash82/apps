# springboot-webflow-demo

#### **Overview**

This proof of concept (PoC) showcases the use of Spring Boot with WebFlux, providing a reactive programming model for building non-blocking, asynchronous web applications. The goal is to demonstrate how to create a reactive RESTful API that can handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.

#### **Features**

Spring Boot: Utilize Spring Boot for rapid application development.

Reactive Programming: Implement a reactive stack using Project Reactor.

Non-Blocking I/O: Leverage WebFlux for handling asynchronous and non-blocking requests.

Reactive Data Access: Use reactive repositories for interacting with databases.

#### **Architecture**

Spring Boot Application: The main application built using Spring Boot and WebFlux.

Reactive API: A RESTful API that responds to requests in a non-blocking manner.

Reactive Data Store: Optional integration with a reactive database (e.g., MongoDB, R2DBC).

#### **Prerequisites**

Java 11+

Maven or Gradle for dependency management
