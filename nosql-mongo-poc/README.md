#### **Overview**

This proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to integrate MongoDB with a Spring Boot application. The goal is to showcase the capabilities of MongoDB as a NoSQL database and how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations seamlessly using Spring Data MongoDB.

#### **Features**

Spring Boot: Leverage Spring Boot for easy setup and configuration of the application.

MongoDB Integration: Use Spring Data MongoDB to interact with a MongoDB database.

CRUD Operations: Implement basic CRUD functionalities to manage data in the MongoDB collection.

RESTful API: Expose a RESTful API to interact with the application.

#### **Architecture**

Spring Boot Application: The main application that handles business logic and API requests.

MongoDB: The NoSQL database used for storing application data.

Repository Layer: Utilizes Spring Data repositories to manage data access.

#### **Prerequisites**

Java 17+

MongoDB installed locally or a MongoDB Atlas account

Maven or Gradle for dependency management
