# microservice-exception-handling

#### **Overview**

This proof of concept (PoC) showcases effective exception handling strategies in a microservices architecture. The goal is to demonstrate how to manage and propagate errors gracefully across services, ensuring robustness and clarity in communication.

#### **Features**

Centralized Error Handling: Implement global exception handlers to manage errors consistently across microservices.

Custom Exception Classes: Define specific exception types for different error scenarios to provide meaningful feedback.

Error Response Structure: Standardize the error response format for clarity and ease of debugging.

Resilience and Fault Tolerance: Demonstrate how to handle failures without affecting the overall system stability.

#### **Architecture**

Microservices: A set of independent services that communicate over HTTP/REST.

Error Handling Middleware: Interceptors or filters that catch and process exceptions before sending responses.

API Gateway (optional): An optional layer that can manage error handling for all incoming requests.


#### **Prerequisites**

Java 17+
Spring Boot for microservices

Maven or Gradle for dependency management
