# springboot-multithreading-example

#### Overview

This proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the use of multithreading in a Spring Boot application to enhance performance and responsiveness. The goal is to showcase how to efficiently manage concurrent tasks and improve the throughput of the application.

#### Features

Spring Boot: Leverage Spring Boot for rapid application development.

Thread Management: Use Java's built-in threading capabilities to execute tasks concurrently.

Task Execution: Implement asynchronous processing for long-running tasks without blocking the main thread.

Thread Pooling: Utilize thread pools to manage resources effectively and control concurrency.

#### Architecture

Spring Boot Application: The main application that handles incoming requests and utilizes multithreading for processing.

Task Executor: A configured executor service to manage the threads and task execution.
