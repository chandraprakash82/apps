# springboot-best-practices

#### **Overview**

This proof of concept (PoC) showcases a simple Spring Boot application that implements basic CRUD operations. The goal is to demonstrate how to create a RESTful API for managing resources, enabling users to perform operations on data efficiently.

#### **Features**

Spring Boot: Utilize Spring Boot for rapid application development.

RESTful API: Implement a RESTful API for handling CRUD operations.

Data Persistence: Use an in-memory database (H2) for simplicity, or connect to a relational database (e.g., MySQL) for more advanced setups.

Entity Management: Define and manage a simple entity (e.g., User) with attributes.

#### **Architecture**

Spring Boot Application: The main application that handles incoming requests and performs CRUD operations.

Database: An in-memory database or a relational database for data storage.

#### **Prerequisites**

Java 11+

Maven or Gradle for dependency management
