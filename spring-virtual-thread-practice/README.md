# spring-virtual-thread

#### Overview

This proof of concept (PoC) showcases the integration of virtual threads in a Spring Boot application, leveraging Project Loom to improve concurrency and scalability. The goal is to demonstrate how virtual threads can simplify the handling of concurrent tasks without the overhead associated with traditional thread management.

#### Features

Spring Boot: Utilize Spring Boot for rapid application development and configuration.

Virtual Threads: Use Java's virtual threads to handle multiple concurrent requests more efficiently.

Asynchronous Processing: Implement non-blocking APIs to enhance application responsiveness.

Simplified Concurrency Model: Reduce complexity in managing threads and synchronization.

#### Architecture

Spring Boot Application: The main application that handles incoming requests and utilizes virtual threads for processing.

Virtual Thread Management: Use of Java's virtual thread capabilities to manage concurrent tasks.

#### Prerequisites

Java 21 or later (with Project Loom support)

Maven or Gradle for dependency management
