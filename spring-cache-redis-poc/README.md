# spring-data-redis-cache
#### **Overview**

This proof of concept (PoC) showcases the integration of Redis as a caching solution in a Spring Boot application. The goal is to demonstrate how to use Redis to improve application performance by caching frequently accessed data.

#### **Features**

Spring Boot: Leverage Spring Boot for rapid application development and configuration.

Redis Integration: Use Spring Data Redis to interact with the Redis caching layer.

Caching Mechanism: Implement caching for service methods to reduce database calls and enhance performance.

TTL (Time-to-Live): Configure cache expiration policies for optimal data freshness.

#### **Architecture**

Spring Boot Application: The main application that handles business logic and caching.

Redis: An in-memory data store used for caching application data.

#### **Prerequisites**

Java 17+

Redis installed and running locally or on a remote server

Maven or Gradle for dependency management
